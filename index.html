  <p>Values: Balance, Dedication, Efficiency, Effort, Growth, Precision <br><br>Isabella is a high school student, club leader, and future nonprofit board member who’s passionate about building meaningful things—whether it’s a robotics team structure, a life skills curriculum, or a tool that makes someone’s day easier. <br><br>She began competitive robotics at 14. At first, she was excited just to be on the hardware team. But after the team didn’t qualify for regionals, she started asking why. She realized she hadn’t learned much that season and wanted to change that. Though she ran for captain and wasn’t elected, she joined a newly formed overflow team and helped turn it into something more. She recruited new members, organized documentation, and was eventually elected captain. That year, the team emphasized learning and balance, qualified for regionals, placed in the top six at every competition, fundraised independently, and proved what they were capable of. <br><br>Along the way, Isabella identified weaknesses in the team’s structure. Roles were too rigid, and communication gaps slowed progress. After consulting with mentors, she introduced a Subject Matter Expert role that allowed members to take ownership of their strengths. The new structure significantly improved collaboration and stuck around even after she stepped back due to health challenges. <br><br>Through these experiences, Isabella discovered that while others often recommend her for leadership positions, her true strength lies in management. Her focus is on planning, organizing, and coordination—ensuring everyone knows their role, deadlines are met, and resources are in place. She's more of a “How do we get this done?” and “Are we doing it correctly?” kind of leader than one who centers around vision or group direction. That self-awareness has allowed her to keep teams and projects running efficiently and smoothly.<br>Today, Isabella serves as the legal, financial, and curriculum manager of The Common Senses (TCS), a student-led initiative progressing toward nonprofit status. The organization teaches life skills to students and adults through hands-on activities, workshops, and resources. Adapting to a collaborative leadership model—where she’s neither above nor below anyone—was a transition, but one that has contributed significantly to her growth.
<br><br>She gravitates toward projects that make life smoother and more meaningful. Whether automating repetitive tasks or creating helpful tools, Isabella is always looking for ways to build systems that support others. She is currently exploring welding and HVAC as hands-on ways to keep learning, creating, and problem-solving.</p>
